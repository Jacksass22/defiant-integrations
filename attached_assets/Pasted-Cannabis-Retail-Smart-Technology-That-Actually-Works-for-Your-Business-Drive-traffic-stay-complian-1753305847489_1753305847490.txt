What This Means for Your Business
You're competing with chains, delivery apps, and the black market

Compliance paperwork and state systems eat hours of staff time

Repeat customer potential is untapped due to poor follow-up

Most local ads and promos don’t comply—or convert

Budtenders don’t always upsell or collect the right customer data

How Smart Technology Fixes These Problems
We help cannabis retailers implement systems that boost revenue, reduce risk, and streamline daily operations—while staying fully compliant.

📍 Attract the Right Local Customers, Consistently
The Problem: Dispensaries often rely on walk-ins or struggle with ad restrictions on Meta/Google.

The Solution: Hyper-local SMS, SEO, and cannabis-compliant ad strategies that drive foot traffic and loyalty.

What This Looks Like:

Geo-targeted SMS campaigns: “25% Off Edibles – Today Only”

Weedmaps/Leafly profile optimization with AI-enhanced listings

SEO landing pages targeting “dispensary near me,” “best sativa in [city]”

QR-coded packaging and displays to collect re-marketing data

Compliant push notifications and mobile wallet passes

Real Results: 5x ROI on local marketing with 2x walk-in conversion

🛍️ Increase Revenue Per Visit with Smart Upsells
The Problem: Budtenders are inconsistent, and most customers don’t know what else to try.

The Solution: Predictive upsells and automated education delivered at the point of sale or via follow-up.

What This Looks Like:

Smart POS prompts: “Pair with this terpene-rich pre-roll”

Upsell bundles based on past behavior (“Your 3rd time? Try concentrates”)

Shelf talkers and digital displays that auto-rotate based on inventory

Personalized offers via SMS/email: “We noticed you like hybrids…”

New product drip campaigns for loyalty members

Real Results: 60% higher revenue per visit and 3x upsell conversion

🧾 Stay Compliant Without Drowning in Paperwork
The Problem: One misstep in tracking, limits, or reporting can lead to fines—or worse.

The Solution: Automations that reduce compliance workload, sync to METRC/BIOTRACK, and alert you before mistakes happen.

What This Looks Like:

Real-time sync between POS, inventory, and state systems

Threshold alerts: “You’re nearing your daily cap for [product]”

Automated ID validation and age verification reminders

Auto-filled state reports and audit logs

Digital SOP tracking for every sale, return, and adjustment

Real Results: 80% reduction in manual compliance tasks

🔁 Build Loyalty with Data-Driven Follow-Up
The Problem: Most dispensaries lose touch with first-time customers—and let repeat revenue walk out the door.

The Solution: Personalized retention and loyalty systems that adapt to purchase history, time since visit, and preferences.

What This Looks Like:

Automated SMS/email: “It’s been 2 weeks—ready to re-up?”

Smart product suggestions based on prior purchases

Birthday rewards and monthly deals for top spenders

Tiered loyalty programs: Bronze, Silver, Gold—with exclusive drops

Refill/reminder campaigns for topicals, tinctures, or cartridges

Real Results: 3x customer retention and 5x referral conversion
