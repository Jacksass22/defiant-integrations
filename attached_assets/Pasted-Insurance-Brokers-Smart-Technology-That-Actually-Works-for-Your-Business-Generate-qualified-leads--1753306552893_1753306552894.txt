How Smart Technology Modernizes Your Brokerage
We help independent brokers and small agencies implement automation systems that handle the follow-up, cross-sells, compliance, and client experience—without relying on generic CRM bloat or risky public tools.

🧲 Attract Qualified, High-Intent Leads
The Problem: You’re spending too much time chasing cold leads—or relying on purchased lists.

The Solution: Lead funnels that attract inbound prospects looking for exactly what you sell.

What This Looks Like:

Google Ads and landing pages targeting “[insurance type] in [city]”

Lead magnets: “Free Coverage Review” or “Save on Your Renewal”

Instant response flows: “Thanks for your request—book a call here”

AI-powered qualification: filters out tire-kickers, routes hot leads

Local SEO + reputation automation (Google, Yelp, etc.)

Real Results: 4x more qualified leads and better close rate

🔁 Automate Renewals & Follow-Ups Without Risk
The Problem: Renewal reminders get missed. So do upsells. And clients drift.

The Solution: Smart, compliant automation flows that re-engage clients on time—every time.

What This Looks Like:

Automated 30/60/90-day renewal notice sequences

SMS + email follow-ups with quote comparisons or new bundles

Birthday and life event check-ins: “New baby? Let’s update your plan”

Lapsed client win-back campaigns

Referral automation: “Know someone who needs coverage?”

Real Results: 60% faster renewals and 3x retention improvement

📂 Simplify Compliance and Documentation
The Problem: Most brokers track compliance manually—leaving room for errors, gaps, or fines.

The Solution: Built-in workflows that document every step, automate disclosures, and store everything securely.

What This Looks Like:

Digital signature and e-document delivery flows

Pre-set compliance language in all templates

Communication logs stored securely with audit trails

ID verification, consent capture, and opt-in tracking

Fully HIPAA + GLBA compliant (plus state-specific privacy options)

Real Results: 100% compliance across client communication, with no extra admin time

💬 Personalize Every Client Experience—At Scale
The Problem: Clients forget you exist until their next renewal—or they switch providers without telling you.

The Solution: Ongoing, intelligent communication that keeps your name top-of-mind year-round.

What This Looks Like:

Annual coverage reviews with automated prompts

Educational content: “What’s Changing in Healthcare This Year?”

Targeted upsell flows: “You’ve got auto—what about renters?”

Client portal for documents, communication, and service requests

Review + testimonial requests that build online reputation
