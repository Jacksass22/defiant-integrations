You're competing against door-to-door storm chasers while building trust with homeowners who've heard horror stories about roofing contractors.

## What Roofing Companies Are Dealing With Right Now

### The Trust Challenge
- **Reputation issues**: Bad actors have hurt the industry's credibility

### What This Means for Your Business
- Homeowners are skeptical and shop multiple contractors
- Insurance delays can kill cash flow and project momentum
- Storm damage creates urgency but also brings out competitors
- Referrals are gold, but you need systems to generate them consistently
- Administrative work (estimates, claims, follow-ups) eats up profitable time
