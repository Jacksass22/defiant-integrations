Add New "What We Do" Section
Create a new section that goes between the hero section (blue background with "What's your next intelligent breakthrough?") and the statistics section (blue square with "Only 23% of companies successfully scale AI beyond pilot projects").
Section Requirements:
Visual Design:

Clean, modern layout with white/light background to contrast with the blue sections above and below
Professional typography that matches the existing site style
Subtle animations or hover effects to keep it engaging
Responsive design that works on all devices

Content Structure:
Create 3-4 main service categories with simple, non-technical language:
1. Smart AI Solutions

Custom AI assistants that handle real business tasks
Automated workflows that save time and reduce errors
Industry-specific AI tools trained for your business
Multi-team AI agents that work together seamlessly

2. Web & Digital Tools

Custom websites and web applications
AI-powered chatbots and customer service tools
Intelligent website search and recommendations
SEO automation and lead generation systems

3. Data & Analytics

Turn your business data into actionable insights
Automated inventory tracking and management
Performance dashboards and reporting
Predictive analytics for better decision-making

4. Strategy & Development

Full-service strategy consulting
Custom app development from concept to launch
Secure, professional development using Python and modern frameworks
Ongoing support and optimization

Key Messaging:

Emphasize "we build it for you" rather than just consulting
Use phrases like "intelligent automation," "smart systems," and "custom solutions"
Highlight that we work across all industries with real developers
Make it clear we handle everything from strategy to implementation

Call-to-Action:
Include a subtle CTA button or link that says something like "See How We Can Help Your Business" or "Explore Our Solutions"
Technical Notes:

Ensure smooth scrolling transitions between sections
Match the existing color scheme and fonts
Keep the section height balanced with surrounding content
Add appropriate spacing and padding for visual hierarchy

Make this section feel like a natural bridge between the inspiring hero message and the credibility-building statistics section that follows.
