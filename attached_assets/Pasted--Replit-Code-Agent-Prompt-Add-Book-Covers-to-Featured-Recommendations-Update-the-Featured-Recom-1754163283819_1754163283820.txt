# Replit Code Agent Prompt: Add Book Covers to Featured Recommendations

Update the Featured Recommendations section (/books page) to include actual book cover images while maintaining the current professional design and layout.

## Requirements:

### 1. Current Design Enhancement
- **Keep existing layout**: Maintain the current 3x2 grid of colored cards
- **Add book covers**: Overlay book cover images on the colored background cards
- **Preserve text**: Keep all existing titles, authors, and descriptions
- **Maintain responsiveness**: Ensure covers look good on all screen sizes

### 2. Book Cover Implementation

**Card Structure Update:**
```
[Colored Background Card]
  ├── [Book Cover Image - positioned in upper portion]
  ├── [Book Title - below cover]
  ├── [Author Name - below title]
  └── [Description - bottom section]
```

**Cover Image Specifications:**
- **Size**: Medium resolution (300-400px width max)
- **Position**: Upper center of each colored card
- **Styling**: Subtle drop shadow for depth
- **Aspect ratio**: Standard book proportions (roughly 2:3 ratio)

### 3. Book Cover Sources

**Find covers for these books:**
1. **Good Strategy Bad Strategy** by Richard Rumelt
2. **The Innovator's Dilemma** by Clayton M. Christensen  
3. **Team of Teams** by General Stanley McChrystal
4. **Thinking, Fast and Slow** by Daniel Kahneman
5. **Zero to One** by Peter Thiel
6. **The Lean Startup** by Eric Ries

**Image Sources:**
- Use **publicly available book covers** from online bookstores
- **Medium quality images** (not ultra high-res publisher materials)
- **Standard book cover format** with readable titles

### 4. Design Integration

**Visual Hierarchy:**
- **Book cover**: Primary visual element in upper 60% of card
- **Title/Author**: Prominent text below cover
- **Description**: Supporting text at bottom
- **Colored backgrounds**: Keep as accent/branding element

**Styling Requirements:**
- **Professional appearance**: Clean, premium look matching site aesthetic
- **Hover effects**: Subtle interaction when hovering over cards
- **Loading optimization**: Compressed images for fast page loads
- **Accessibility**: Alt text for all book cover images

### 5. Layout Adjustments

**Card Proportions:**
- **Increase card height** slightly to accommodate book covers
- **Maintain grid spacing** and responsive behavior
- **Balance text and image** for optimal visual hierarchy
- **Preserve mobile experience** with appropriately sized covers

**Typography Updates:**
- **Ensure text remains readable** against colored backgrounds
- **Maintain font sizes** and styling consistency
- **Proper contrast** between text and background colors

### 6. Interactive Elements

**Enhanced User Experience:**
- **Clickable cards**: Make entire card area clickable (future purchase links)
- **Hover animations**: Subtle scale or shadow effects on hover
- **Loading states**: Graceful image loading with placeholders
- **Fallback handling**: Show colored card if image fails to load

### 7. Performance Considerations

**Optimization:**
- **Compress images** for fast loading while maintaining quality
- **Lazy loading**: Load images as they come into viewport
- **WebP format** if supported, with JPG fallbacks
- **Responsive images**: Different sizes for mobile vs desktop

### 8. Legal Compliance

**Implementation Notes:**
- **Editorial use**: Images used for book recommendation purposes
- **Small disclaimer**: Add subtle text "Book covers used for editorial recommendations"
- **Attribution ready**: Structure to easily add purchase links later
- **Fair use compliance**: Medium-sized images with educational commentary

## Expected Result:

Transform the current text-only book recommendation cards into visually engaging book showcases that:
- **Look professional** and match McKinsey-style business publications
- **Maintain current branding** with colored backgrounds and typography
- **Improve user engagement** through visual book recognition
- **Preserve performance** with optimized images and responsive design
- **Enable future enhancements** like purchase links and expanded book collections

The final result should look like a premium business publication's book recommendation section while maintaining the site's sophisticated aesthetic and professional credibility.
