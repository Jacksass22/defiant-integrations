Golf Courses: Elevate the Guest Experience, Streamline Operations
Run a smoother pro shop, handle more calls at once, and never miss a tee time again.
Modern golf courses juggle phone lines, bookings, guest services, staff management, and pro shop sales—often with outdated tools and overworked teams. At Defiant Integrations, we bring intelligent systems and automation to the game, helping you eliminate friction, delight guests, and operate with precision.

What We Solve
📞 Intelligent Phone Reception & Call Filtering
Free your staff from the phones—without losing the human touch.
Our AI-powered phone assistant handles high-volume, repetitive calls—like:

Tee time availability

Hours of operation

Weather conditions and cart rules

Rates and specials

Event info

When someone calls with a personal or one-off request (e.g., “Did someone turn in a lost club?”), the system instantly routes them to your pro shop for human assistance. No menus, no confusion—just smarter service.

✔️ Real-time tee sheet and calendar integration
✔️ Staff alerted only when human input is needed
✔️ 24/7 coverage with zero missed calls
