# Replit Code Agent Prompt: Proof of Concept Section Page

Create a sophisticated Proof of Concept capability page showcasing rapid AI prototyping and validation. Match the existing McKinsey-level aesthetic with innovation and experimentation visual elements.

## Page Design Requirements:

### Visual Design:
- **Hero section**: 60/40 split with content left, interactive prototype demo right
- **Color scheme**: Primary blues, accent oranges for experimentation, professional grays
- **Premium elements**: Floating cards, prototype mockups, testing/validation graphics
- **Interactive elements**: Live demos, before/after comparisons, rapid prototyping animations

## Content Structure:

### Hero Section:
**Headline**: "Proof of Concept Development: See Your AI Vision In Action Within Weeks"
**Subheadline**: "Rapid prototyping that transforms AI ideas into working demonstrations - proving business value and technical feasibility before full investment."

### Value Metrics (3-column grid):
- **2-6 weeks** From concept to working prototype
- **$10K-25K** Fixed-price proof of concept development
- **95%** Client satisfaction with prototype outcomes

### Core POC Services (4-column grid):
1. **Rapid Prototyping** - Working AI demos built in 2-6 weeks
2. **Feasibility Assessment** - Technical and business viability analysis
3. **Risk Validation** - Early identification of challenges and solutions
4. **Business Case Development** - ROI projections and implementation roadmaps

### POC Development Process:
**"The VALIDATE Framework"** - 6-phase rapid prototyping methodology:
Vision → Assess → Learn → Implement → Deploy → Advance → Test → Evolve

### POC Specializations (3-column showcase):
- **AI-Powered Automation**: Workflow automation prototypes with immediate impact demonstration
- **Intelligent Analytics**: Custom dashboard and insight generation proof of concepts
- **Customer Experience AI**: Chatbots, recommendation engines, personalization demos

### Success Stories (3 horizontal cards):
- **E-commerce**: Product recommendation POC led to 40% conversion increase
- **SaaS**: Customer health scoring prototype reduced churn by 35%
- **Manufacturing**: Predictive maintenance POC prevented $500K in downtime

### POC Deliverables:
**What You Get:**
- Working prototype demonstration
- Technical feasibility analysis
- Business impact projections
- Implementation roadmap
- Risk assessment and mitigation plan

### Investment & Timeline:
**POC Packages:**
- **Basic POC**: $10K-15K (2-4 weeks, single AI application)
- **Advanced POC**: $15K-25K (4-6 weeks, integrated system prototype)
- **Enterprise POC**: $25K-40K (6-8 weeks, complex multi-system demonstration)

### Rapid Development Approach:
**Week-by-Week Breakdown:**
- **Week 1**: Requirements gathering and prototype design
- **Week 2-3**: Core development and initial testing
- **Week 4**: Integration, refinement, and demonstration prep
- **Week 5-6**: Advanced features and business case development

### Technology Stack:
No-code/low-code platforms, rapid AI frameworks, cloud deployment, iterative development tools

### Call-to-Action:
**Primary**: "Start Your AI Proof of Concept"
**Secondary**: Download POC guide, see prototype demos, schedule consultation

## Technical Implementation:

### Interactive Features:
- Live prototype demonstrations
- Before/after comparison sliders
- Rapid development timeline visualization
- ROI calculator for POC investment

### Brand Consistency:
- Match existing navigation/footer
- Use established color palette
- Maintain professional typography
- Consistent button styles and spacing
