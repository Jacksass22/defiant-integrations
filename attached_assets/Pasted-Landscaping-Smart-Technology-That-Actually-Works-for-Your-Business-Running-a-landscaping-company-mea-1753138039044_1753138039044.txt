Landscaping
Smart Technology That Actually Works for Your Business
Running a landscaping company means dealing with weather, seasonal demands, and customers who want their yards to look perfect year-round. You're competing for high-value projects while managing crews, dealing with equipment, and trying to keep customers happy when Mother Nature doesn't cooperate.
Meanwhile, you're still using pen and paper for estimates, forgetting to follow up with potential clients, and missing out on social media opportunities that could showcase your best work to attract premium customers.
There's a better way. Our AI solutions help landscaping companies like yours generate more leads, showcase your work professionally, and grow beyond just mowing lawns.

What Landscaping Companies Are Dealing With Right Now
The Seasonal Reality

Weather dependency: Rain cancels jobs, droughts affect growth, seasons dictate revenue
Feast or famine: Slammed in spring/summer, scrambling for work in winter
Labor challenges: Seasonal workers, crew management, and finding reliable help
Customer education: People don't understand what quality landscaping costs
Marketing struggles: Your best work is invisible unless you show it off

What This Means for Your Business

Premium landscaping projects go to companies with better marketing
Customers choose based on price because they can't see the difference in quality
Seasonal slowdowns hurt cash flow and crew retention
Word-of-mouth isn't enough to grow beyond your current neighborhood
Time spent on estimates and follow-ups takes away from actual landscaping
