# Replit Code Agent Prompt: Pilot Program Section Page

Create a sophisticated Pilot Program capability page showcasing controlled AI implementation and scaling validation. Match the existing McKinsey-level aesthetic with testing and gradual rollout visual elements.

## Page Design Requirements:

### Visual Design:
- **Hero section**: 50/50 split with content left, phased rollout visualization right
- **Color scheme**: Primary blues, accent greens for success metrics, professional grays
- **Premium elements**: Floating cards, staged deployment graphics, success tracking dashboards
- **Interactive elements**: Pilot timeline animations, success metrics displays, scaling visualizations

## Content Structure:

### Hero Section:
**Headline**: "Pilot Programs That Prove AI Value Before Full-Scale Deployment"
**Subheadline**: "Controlled AI implementations that demonstrate real business impact, validate assumptions, and provide the confidence to scale organization-wide."

### Value Metrics (3-column grid):
- **3-6 months** Typical pilot program duration
- **$25K-75K** Pilot program investment range
- **85%** Pilots that progress to full implementation

### Core Pilot Services (4-column grid):
1. **Controlled Deployment** - Limited-scope implementation with real users and data
2. **Success Measurement** - Comprehensive metrics tracking and impact analysis
3. **Risk Management** - Gradual rollout with safety nets and rollback procedures
4. **Scaling Strategy** - Roadmap from pilot success to organization-wide adoption

### Pilot Development Process:
**"The SCALE Framework"** - 5-phase pilot methodology:
Scope → Configure → Activate → Learn → Evolve

### Pilot Program Types (3-column showcase):
- **Department Pilot**: Single team or department implementation (3-4 months)
- **Process Pilot**: Specific workflow or business process automation (4-5 months)
- **Customer Pilot**: Limited customer-facing AI implementation (5-6 months)

### Success Stories (3 horizontal cards):
- **Sales Team Pilot**: AI lead scoring increased qualified leads by 60% in 3 months
- **Customer Service Pilot**: Automated support reduced response time by 75%
- **Operations Pilot**: Inventory optimization saved $200K in first 6 months

### Pilot Program Benefits:
**Why Start with a Pilot:**
- Demonstrate ROI with real business metrics
- Identify and resolve implementation challenges
- Build organizational confidence and buy-in
- Validate technical assumptions with real data
- Create internal champions and success stories

### Investment & Scope:
**Pilot Packages:**
- **Team Pilot**: $25K-40K (10-20 users, single process)
- **Department Pilot**: $40K-60K (50-100 users, multiple workflows)
- **Enterprise Pilot**: $60K-75K (100+ users, integrated systems)

### Pilot Success Metrics:
**What We Measure:**
- Business impact and ROI validation
- User adoption and satisfaction rates
- Technical performance and reliability
- Process efficiency improvements
- Cost savings and revenue impact

### Pilot to Production Timeline:
**Typical Journey:**
- **Month 1**: Pilot setup and initial deployment
- **Month 2-3**: Active testing and optimization
- **Month 4**: Results analysis and scaling plan
- **Month 5-6**: Full implementation preparation
- **Month 7+**: Organization-wide deployment

### Risk Mitigation:
**Built-in Safety Measures:**
- Gradual user onboarding and training
- Continuous monitoring and performance tracking
- Rollback procedures for any issues
- Regular stakeholder communication and reporting

### Call-to-Action:
**Primary**: "Launch Your AI Pilot Program"
**Secondary**: Download pilot guide, see case studies, schedule planning session

## Technical Implementation:

### Interactive Features:
- Pilot timeline with milestone tracking
- Success metrics dashboard
- Scaling visualization from pilot to full deployment
- ROI progression charts

### Brand Consistency:
- Match existing navigation/footer
- Use established color palette
- Maintain professional typography
- Consistent button styles and spacing
