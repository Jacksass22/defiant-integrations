Cannabis Retail Automation Consulting

Built for Growth. Designed for Compliance. Powered by Intelligence.

Running a dispensary isn’t what it used to be. Today, cannabis retailers are balancing evolving compliance demands, razor-thin margins, overwhelmed staff, and sky-high customer expectations—all while trying to grow.

We work with operators who want to run smarter, scale faster, and deliver consistently standout experiences—without adding more tools or more stress.

Why Top Cannabis Operators Partner With Us

Most cannabis shops are juggling a patchwork of disconnected systems. POS doesn’t talk to marketing. Compliance is a daily fire drill. Staff spend more time explaining than selling. Important tasks fall through the cracks. Customers leave because no one follows up.

You don’t need another app... (though we can build you one if you do need one) —you need a smarter way to run your operation.

We help bring your systems together into a clean, automated, and scalable structure. It’s not about replacing your tools—it’s about making them work in harmony.

And most importantly: your staff doesn’t have to lift a finger. Every automation we build is designed to operate quietly in the background, so your team can keep focusing on what they do best—without taking on more work.

What Changes When Things Just Flow

→ Traffic becomes predictable.Geo-targeted campaigns, optimized local visibility, and smarter promotions help bring in the right customers—consistently.

→ Staff focus on people, not busywork.Front desk distractions disappear. SOPs get followed. Everyone’s clear on what matters most each day. AI assistants are available 24/7 to answer internal questions and guide SOPs on the spot.

→ Compliance gets easier, not riskier.You stay ahead of state systems and daily reporting—without sweating it. Reports prepare themselves, thresholds are tracked automatically, and alerts surface problems before they escalate.

→ Customers actually come back.Smart touchpoints, helpful education, and personalized re-engagement build trust and loyalty. Drip campaigns, review requests, and promo timing all happen automatically.

→ You see what’s working.Sales, marketing, inventory, and staff performance all in one dashboard—no spreadsheet wrangling required.

→ New staff get up to speed fast.Custom in-store tools and smart onboarding flows make training easier. Staff can ask your custom AI assistant what to do in real-time—no more confusion, no more cluttered SOP docs.
