Business Logic Rules:
Savings Caps by Revenue:

Never show savings exceeding 50% of annual revenue
Labor savings capped at 60% of estimated current labor costs
Revenue growth capped at realistic industry benchmarks
Total savings should be 3-5x the annual investment

Investment Logic:

Setup costs scale with business complexity, not just size
Monthly costs should be 0.8-2% of annual revenue
Total annual investment should be 8-15% of annual revenue
ROI should be calculated over 12-18 months, not just savings

Professional Disclaimers:

"ROI based on average client results over 12-18 months"
"Individual results vary based on current operations and implementation"
"Savings projections based on industry benchmarks and client data"
"Full benefits typically realized within 3-6 months of implementation"

The goal is to show compelling returns that smart business owners will believe and invest in, while accurately reflecting the value you provide.
