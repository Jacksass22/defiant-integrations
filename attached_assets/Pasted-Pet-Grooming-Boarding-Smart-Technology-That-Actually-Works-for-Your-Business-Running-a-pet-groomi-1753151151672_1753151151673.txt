Pet Grooming & Boarding
Smart Technology That Actually Works for Your Business

Running a pet grooming or boarding business means more than just caring for animals—you’re juggling appointments, managing staff, handling last-minute cancellations, and trying to keep both pets and their owners happy. Meanwhile, your phone rings off the hook, your social media hasn’t been updated in weeks, and you're constantly chasing no-shows or follow-ups.

At the same time, new competitors are popping up with flashy Instagram pages, online booking systems, and fancy CRM tools. They're attracting repeat clients and leaving you to rely on word-of-mouth and outdated scheduling methods.

There's a better way.
Our AI solutions help pet businesses like yours streamline operations, stay top-of-mind with customers, and create consistent, stress-free growth—without needing a tech degree to use them.

What Pet Grooming & Boarding Businesses Are Dealing With Right Now
Industry-Specific Challenges
Last-minute cancellations hurt your schedule and revenue.

Missed calls often mean missed bookings.

Pet owners expect professional communication and reminders.

One-time visits rarely turn into long-term clients.

You’re doing amazing work, but no one sees it online.

Stats That Matter:

72% of grooming appointments are booked via phone—and 1 in 3 calls go unanswered.

60% of pet owners say they would book recurring grooming if automated reminders were in place.

5x higher engagement on social media posts that include pets’ before/after shots.

What This Means for Your Business
Without systems in place, you're stuck doing everything manually—losing time, losing clients, and losing sleep. Competitors with better tech are winning over your customers, not because they’re better groomers, but because they communicate better and stay visible. Your hard work should be generating consistent income—not random bookings.
